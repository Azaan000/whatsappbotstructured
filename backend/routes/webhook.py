# already handled. Two fixes vs. the old plain `set()`:
#   1. Bounded via a deque + set pair, evicting the OLDEST ids once we hit
#      the cap — instead of `.clear()`-ing the whole cache, which used to
#      forget everything at once and let old retried messages slip through
#      and get reprocessed (duplicate AI replies / duplicate sends).
#   2. Guarded by a lock so the check-and-reserve is atomic — two
#      near-simultaneous webhook deliveries for the same message id can no
#      longer both pass the "not seen yet" check before either records it.
