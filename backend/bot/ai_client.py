# ── Shared HTTP session ───────────────────────────────────────────────
# Plain `requests.post(...)` opens a brand-new TCP + TLS connection on
# every single call — every customer message pays a fresh handshake to
# openrouter.ai even though we're hitting the exact same host over and
# over. A shared Session with a pooled HTTPAdapter reuses the
# underlying connection (HTTP keep-alive) across calls, which cuts a
# meaningful chunk of latency off every AI reply (typically ~150-400ms
# saved per call after the first, more on slower networks). This is
# the single biggest easy win for "make AI replies faster" since it
# costs nothing functionally and touches no business logic.
